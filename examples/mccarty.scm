; Dancer Benchmark.  McCarty's original formulation

              (not (ballerina ?x))))
    
    (rule r12
          (if (dancer ?x)
              (graceful ?x)))
    
    (rule r13
          (if (and (dancer ?x)

              (ballerina ?x)))))


;     This formulation of the rules is problematical. The intention is to express 
;     that dancers are not normally or usually ballerinas.  
;     But can one construct an argument for someone not being a
;     ballerina by showing that she is a dancer?  Does her being a dancer 
;     give us a *reason* to believe she is not a ballerina?
;     If someone has put forward an argument for someone being a ballerina,
;     should it be possible to rebut this argument by proving she is a dancer?
;     In particular, if one uses r12 to argue that she is a ballerina, by
;     proving she is a graceful dancer, should it be possible to rebut this
;     argument by showing she is a dancer?  In my view, r11 illustrates two
;     different interpretations of defeasible rules:  1) as expressions of 
;     normality conditions (e.g. dancers are not normally ballerinas) and 
;     2) as inference rules or argumentation schemes for guiding reasoning 
;     (e.g. to argue that someone is a ballerina, prove she is a graceful 
;     dancer.)  Carneades is designed only for this second purpose, 
;     representing argumentation schemes.

;     Also, r12 and r13 alone hardly make sense as an expression
;     of reasoning policy.  With just these two rules, all dancers
;     are presumably ballerinas.  The second condition of r13 serves
;     no purpose. 

;     Here is a reformulation of the rulebase which makes more sense to me.
;     The policy issue is whether it is better to presume that 
;     someone is graceful, knowing that he or she is a dancer.  
;     In this rulebase, it is presumed that a dancer is graceful, unless
;     it is shown that the dancer is a rock-and-roller's or square dancer.
;     That is, the policy implemented by these rules errs on the side of 
;     concluding that a dancer is graceful when he or she is not.
