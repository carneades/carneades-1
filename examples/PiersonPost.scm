;   a scheme for "practical reasoning" in legal argument.
; See Atkinson, Bench-Capon, McBurney, "Arguing About Cases
;  as Practical Reasoning",  ICAIL05.  The following is a recontruction
; of the arguments in the published opinion, not a reconstruction

; The full text of the decision can be found at:
