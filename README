This is the deprecated version of Carneades, implemented in R6RS Scheme, which was developed during the European ESTRELLA project (IST-2004-027655) from 2006-2008. In the meantime, Carneades has been reimplemented in Clojure and ported to the Java Virtual Machine.  See https://github.com/carneades/carneades for this new version.
