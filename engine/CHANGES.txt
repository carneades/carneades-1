Version 0.1.4  (July 29, 2008)

- Ported the whole system to R6RS Scheme.  (Expect more bugs than usual.)
- The distribution now includes the JavaFX sources of the beginnings 
  of a graphical user interface for Carneades
- Now includes an argument generator for Description Logic Programs  
  represented in the KRSS language.

Version 0.1.3

- Began renaming Scheme source files to use the .ss suffix.
- Renamed the "lib" directory to the more usual "src".
- Added the GNU LGPL license and copyright notices

Version 0.1.2

- corrected bug in shell.scm: Failing to find a proof of P is not the same as
  finding a proof of (not P).
- updated the installation instructions.  

Version 0.1.1

- Reorganized the directories to make it easier to include the Carneades 
  source files in a list of directory paths containing Scheme libraries.
- Modified all the examples to import Carneades files from the Carneades 
  library, rather than using path names relative to the directory of the 
  source file of the example.  
- Added a new example, mccarty.scm, with some standard benchmarks from the
  nonmontonic logic literature.

Version of 12 February, 2008

- Commented out search for rebuttals or questioning assumptions in
  make-successor-state of argument-search.scm, to reduce the search space
  and improve performance, but at the expense of completeness.  Shouldn't
  negatively affect any of the pilot applications in ESTRELLA.
- Changed question, accept, reject, assert, update in argument.scm to 
  take a fixed number of arguments instead, with the last argument being a list.
- Fixed a bug in the LKIF importer: all imported rules were strict.

Version of 7 February, 2008

- Fixed a bug in the LKIF exporter (improper <and> element)
- Add a "shell" module, to make it easier to construct inference engines 
  and query knowledge bases. The examples have been modified to illustrate 
  the use of this module.

Version of 4 February, 2008

- Fixed bug in rule.scm which checks whether a rule has already been tried.  
  This reduces the size of the search space and avoids (some) duplication of 
  arguments.
- Refactored code and consolidated argument-state.scm into argument-search.scm
- Redefined the type of argument generators in argument-search.scm
  to: statement state -> (stream-of response), where a response encapsulates 
  an argument and a set of substitutions
- Modified all argument generators to match the new type for generators.

Version of January 31, 2008

- Fixed bug in add-rule of rule.scm which caused a rule to be indexed multiple 
  times for rules with several concluions with the same predicate.  This bug 
  enlarged the search space and duplicated solutions for some queries.
- Fixed a serious bug in the rules module, rule.scm, which affected 
  completeness and efficiency.
- Fixed more bugs in the LKIF importer and exporter and also cleaned up 
  the code some.

Version of January 17, 2008

- Fixed some bugs in the LKIF exporter.
- Extended the LKIF exporter to generate ids and summarizes for the statements 
  of premises and conclusions in argument graphs.
- Added a summarize function to the statements module, for generating 
  a default string representation of statements.


Version of January 15, 2008

- Fixed bug in LKIF.scm
- Added an instantiated-arguments procedure to argument-state.scm, which
  returns the argument graph of the state with its variables instantiated 
  with their values in the substitutions of the state. Useful for exporting 
  arguments graphs found using argument-search to LKIF.

Version of January 14, 2008

- Modified the CBR module (cases.scm) to conform more closely to the 
  specifications of the University of Liverpool, as published in the 
  Jurix 2007 paper of Adam Wyner and Trevor Bench-Capon.
- Updated the CBR example in the examples/Liverpool to include more 
  CATO factors and more cases from the CATO/HYPO casebase.

Version of January 8, 2008

- added a module for reasoning with testimonial evidence (evidence.scm) 
which is capable of interviewing users to acquire "facts".  
- modified the family-support, KnowledgeTools and Hungarian (vat.scm) 
examples to illustrate the new evidence module
- changed named of "dist" directory to "Carneades"
          
Version of December 20, 2007

- disjunction ("or"). The body of a rule can now also be a
disjunction of a conjunction of conditions
- eval builtin.  Any Scheme expression can be evaluated in rules.
- case-based reasoning, first version.  (case.scm)  
- generator for arguments from argument graphs (argument-from-arguments.scm).
- view* modified to take a statement->string parameter
- text structure in the statement module allows more control over the 
presentation of statements.  
  See contract.scm for example use.
- config.scm file has changed to allow choice of graphic formats 
(PNG, PostScript or SVG)
- added make-successor-state to argument-state.scm.  Simplifies the 
implementation of argument generators.
