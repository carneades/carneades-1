These installation instructions are for the Carneades inference engine,
implemented in the Scheme programming language, not for the graphical user
interface implemented in JavaFX.

1. Prerequisites

- An implementation of Scheme complying with the latest R6RS 
  standard <http://www.r6rs.org>.
- GraphViz <http://www.graphviz.org/>

Carneades has been tested thus far using PLT Scheme, version 4.x:
	<http://www.plt-scheme.org> 
Ikarus Scheme: 
	<http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~aghuloum/ikarus/index.html>
and Ypsilon Scheme:Scheme:
	<http://code.google.com/p/ypsilon/>

2. Downloading Carneades

Carneades is available for downloading from
	<http://carneades.berlios.de>  

Alternatively, the sources can be downloaded using either the SVN or the Bazaar source code management system:

	$ svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/carneades/trunk
	$ bzr branch lp:~vcs-imports/carneades/trunk

3. Installation

- First create a directory for the sources.  We'll refer to this
directory below as CARNEADES_HOME.  (You do not need to create an 
environment variable with this name.)

- Move the .zip file containing the sources you downloaded above to 
CARNEADES_HOME. 

- Change directories to CARNEADES_HOME.

- Unpack the zip file in this directory.

The Scheme source files of the Carneades engine should now be in 
the CARNEADES_HOME/engine/src/carneades directory inside the CARNEADES_HOME directory.

- The .zip file can now be deleted.

- Install the Scheme libraries in CARNEADES_HOME/engine/src 
so that they will be available  to the implementation of R6RS Scheme you 
are using.  The procedure for doing this varies from implementation to 
implementation.  Using Ikarus, for example, the shell variable
named IKARUS_LIBRARY_PATH should be set to include the CARNEADES_HOME/engine/src
directory.

4. Configuration

- In the CARNEADES_HOME/engine/src/carneades directory, edit the config.scm file to select your
preferred graphics format for displaying argument graphs (png, ps, or
svg) and specify the full path to some application for viewing graphics
in this format.  The config.scm file includes some examples for both
Windows and Mac OS X.

5. Trying it out

- The examples directory and its subdirectories contains numerous
Scheme programs illustrating the Carneades library.
  
- The way to execute these programs depends on the implementation of 
R6RS Scheme you are using.  For exmaple, to run the experts.scm 
example using Ikarus, execute:

$ scheme-script experts.scm | dot -Tpdf > experts.pdf

The experts.scm program produces an argument diagram in dot format.  
The command above pipes this dot file to the dot program, which is part of 
the GraphViz package, producing a nice PDF file containing the diagram.

Here's how to run the same program using version 4.x of PLT Scheme:

$ plt-r6rs ++path CARNEADES_HOME/engine/src experts.scm | dot -Tpdf > experts.pdf
