 (carneades evidence)
 
 ; Implementation of an argumentation scheme for arguments from evidence, in particular testimonial evidence.
 ; Questions and answers represent statements of the form (<predicate> <subject> <object>), i.e. triples as in RDF.
 ; The <predicate> and <subject> must be instantiated when asking the question.  The only information 
 ; requested are the <object> values.  An <object> may be any Scheme datum.  Propositional logic is simulated
 ; with triples of the form (<proposition> #t <boolean>).   For example, a propositional version of "It is not the 
 ; case that Tweety flies." can be represented (tweety-flies #t #f).
 
 
 ; To do:
 ;
 ; - critical questions for testimonial evidence
 ; - default values for questions, possibly
 ; - additional data types for questions, in particular dates.
 ; - extend LKIF.scm to support the importing and exporting of forms, questions and answers.

 ; for each property of each object, separately.  For example, if the
