 ; If the answer is closed, the absence of a value in the list of values can be used to 
 ; generate a con argument, using the "closed-world assumption".  A better term for this here
 ; might be the "closed-world assertion". Notice that this assertion is not global, but made
 ; for each property of each object, separately.  For example, if the 
 ; issue is (p s o), p is closed for s and o is not in the list of values for p of s, then
 ; an the testimony can be used to make an argument con (p s o).
 ; If the user does not know the answer to a question, and thus cannot provide some (or any) values,
 ; an answer record for the question will be nonetheless associated with the question in 
 ; the answers table of the user's testimony.  This answer will be open (not closed) and the 
 ; list of values provided may be empty. The presence of the answer in the answer table records
 ; that the question has been asked, however many values were supplied.
